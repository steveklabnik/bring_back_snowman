# BringBackSnowman

You know you miss this little guy: â˜ƒ.

If you don't know what that's about, [this blog post explains what's
up](http://intertwingly.net/blog/2010/07/29/Rails-and-Snowmen).

With the impending release of Rails 4, I was thinking about fun things in the
history of Rails, and thought it'd be fun to bring him back.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bring_back_snowman'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bring_back_snowman

## Usage

Just do it, and your forms will submit `_snowman=â˜ƒ` to ensure that your data
is encoded in UTF-8.

It is configurable, if you prefer something else. Add this to your
`application.rb`:

```ruby
config.snowman = {:emoji => "ðŸ˜¢"}
```

The key of the configuration hash will be the name of the url parameter. You can use UTF-8 characters for the key too.

You may also need to add the 'magic comment' at the top of the file:

```ruby
# encoding: UTF-8
```

Please remember that if you don't use something that's UTF-8, this won't
actually work to fix the bug.
